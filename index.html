<h3>Git</h3>
<p>Git:
Imagine you're writing a story, and you want to keep track of all the changes you make. Git is like a magical notebook that remembers every version of your story. So, if you make a mistake or want to go back to an earlier version, Git helps you do that without losing your work.

<h3>GitHub</h3>
<p>
Think of GitHub as a special library where you can store your story's notebook (Git repository) online. This library lets you collaborate with friends. You can show them your story, and they can suggest changes or even write their own parts. GitHub keeps everything organized, making it easy for everyone to work together on the same story.</p>
